# C++ Prime Number Programs by AZEEM

What is a prime number? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number

The following facts are good to know before writing prime numbers' programs:

1.	There is only one EVEN prime number i.e. 2.

2.	For a prime test, you don't have to test all the numbers. You can test a number up to its square root only (See above Wikipedia link).

3.	The C++ `<cmath>` header provides a `sqrt()` standard library function. Use `<math.h>` header file for `sqrt()` when writing in C language.

This collection contains various C++ codes for the following:
-	Prime Number Test
-	Prime Numbers Generation
-	Prime Numbers Generation (Reverse)
-	Emirp Number Test (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirp)
-	Prime Factors ...

Any suggestions to improve or enhance these codes are always welcome.
